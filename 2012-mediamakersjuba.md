Juba, Republic of South Sudan

Media&Makers: JUBA 2012 – Open Knowledge and Sustainable Media Forum brought together policy makers, journalists, researchers, open source developers, and civil society stakeholders to develop scenarios for a sustainable media sector and civil society in South Sudan, with an emphasis on openness, accessibility and transparency.

Let’s create the world’s first Open Source Country – a new model for Africa and the world! In collaboration with leading African and international open source and open knowledge specialists the event explored potential elements of a new ‘open source culture’ in South Sudan that can tackle issues of post-conflict transformation, ICT innovation, education, resource management, policy transparency and economic development. The process will examine established and prospective South Sudanese open knowledge, development and cultural collaboration projects with the aim to create a strong, sustainable and open civil society.
