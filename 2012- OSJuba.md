#OSJUBA is a conference and workshop held in Berlin on 21-22 June 2012 that brought together international development experts, open tech specialists, hacktivists, artists and policy makers to discuss methods, platforms and Open Source projects that could be used in post-conflict transformation regions such as the newly independent Republic of South Sudan. The goal of the conference was to encourage and discuss a new discourse for truly sustainable post-conflict development focusing on Open Source methodologies, opportunities and knowledge sharing.

## What

By bringing together leading developers, artists and policy makers #OSJUBA will identify and present innovative Open Source projects, platforms and methodologies that are being used to define new forms of practice, particularly in regions challenged by post-conflict reconstruction, lack of infrastructure, and poverty barring access to basic needs. Exemplary projects that are being implemented to strengthen and develop self-determination, global citizenship and freedom of expression will be mapped by identifying stakeholders and best practice examples. With the aim of creating a vocabulary and tool kit of Open Source Culture for Development #OSJUBA hopes to encourage a new discourse for development and post-conflict resolution.
